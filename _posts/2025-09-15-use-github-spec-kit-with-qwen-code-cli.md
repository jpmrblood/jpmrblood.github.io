### Constitution Principles
The Spec Kit follows a "constitution" of development principles:
- **Simplicity First**: Limit projects to â‰¤3 components, avoid future-proofing
- **Anti-Abstraction**: Use frameworks directly, maintain single model representations
- **Integration-First**: Define contracts and tests before implementation
- **Library-First**: Every feature begins as a standalone library

## Why Use QWEN Code CLI?

QWEN Code CLI offers unique advantages for Spec Kit integration:

### Fork Relationship with Gemini
- **QWEN Code CLI** is a fork of Gemini CLI specialized for QWEN LLM models
- **Structural Compatibility**: Shares the same configuration architecture as Gemini
- **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Leverages QWEN's advanced coding and reasoning abilities
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Access to comprehensive file operations, web search, and shell commands

- **Multilingual Support**: Enhanced support for non-English development contexts
- **Cost-Effective**: Competitive pricing for extended usage

## Prerequisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have the following:

### System Requirements
- **QWEN Code CLI** (latest version recommended)
- **Astral UV** package manager (for Spec Kit installation)
- **Git** for repository operations
- **Python 3.8+** (for UV compatibility)
- **At least 1GB free disk space** (for configurations and temporary files)
- **Supported OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2)

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check QWEN CLI installation
qwen --version

# Check UV installation
uv --version

# Check Python version
python --version
# Should show Python 3.8+

# Check Git
git --version
```

For detailed installation instructions, refer to our articles on [installing Astral UV](/posts/2025-09-04-install-astral-uv) and [installing Qwen CLI with Bun](/posts/2025-09-09-install-gemini-opencode-qwen-cli-with-bun).

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

```bash
# Ensure you're in a clean directory
mkdir spec-kit-qwen-integration
cd spec-kit-qwen-integration

# Verify QWEN CLI is accessible
qwen --version

# Verify UV is installed
uv --version
```

### Step 3: Configure QWEN Integration

After initialization, Spec Kit creates a `.gemini` directory. Since QWEN Code CLI is a fork of Gemini CLI, the configuration is compatible, but you need to rename the directory:

```bash
mv .gemini .qwen
```

This crucial step aligns the configuration with QWEN's expected directory structure.

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check that the rename was successful
ls -la | grep qwen

# Verify QWEN CLI can access the configuration
qwen config list
```

### Step 5: Test Integration

```bash
# Launch QWEN Code CLI in the project
qwen

# Within QWEN CLI, test Spec Kit commands
/specify Create a simple todo application with user authentication

/plan Use React for frontend, Node.js for backend, MongoDB for database

/tasks
```

## Integration with AI Applications

### QWEN Code CLI Integration

The integration allows you to use Spec Kit commands directly within QWEN CLI:

1. **Launch QWEN CLI** in your configured project directory
2. **Use Spec Kit Commands**:
   - `/specify` - Create specifications
   - `/plan` - Generate implementation plans
   - `/tasks` - Break down into executable tasks
   - `/implement` - Execute implementation

### Configuration for QWEN CLI

**Note**: This section is purely informational. QWEN CLI comes with sensible defaults and typically requires no configuration changes for basic Spec Kit integration. The commands below are optional optimizations for advanced users.

Ensure your QWEN CLI settings support the integration:

```bash
# Check current configuration
qwen config list

# Set appropriate model for spec work
qwen config set model qwen-coder-plus

# Enable long context if available
qwen config set context-window 128k
```

### Other Compatible Tools

While primarily designed for QWEN CLI, the setup is compatible with:
- **Claude Code**: Use `--ai claude` instead of `--ai gemini`
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use `--ai copilot` for VS Code integration
- **Cursor**: Use `--ai cursor` for Cursor IDE integration
