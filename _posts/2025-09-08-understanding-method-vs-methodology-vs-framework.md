In project management and software development, three fundamental terms—method, methodology, and framework—are often used to describe different approaches to managing work. Rather than competing concepts, these terms represent complementary tools that help project managers, developers, and teams achieve their goals. Understanding what each term means and how they work together is essential for effective project execution.

This guide provides clear definitions of each concept, explains how they relate to one another, and offers practical examples to illustrate their application in real-world scenarios.

## What is a Method?

A **method** is a specific technique, procedure, or approach used to accomplish a particular task or solve a specific problem. Methods are the building blocks of project management—practical tools that can be applied to individual aspects of a project.

### Characteristics of Methods
- **Specific and Focused**: Methods address particular challenges or tasks
- **Tactical in Nature**: They provide step-by-step procedures for implementation
