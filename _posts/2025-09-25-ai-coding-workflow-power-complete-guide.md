# The True Power of AI Coding: Building Your Own Workflow

## 1. Introduction: Beyond Prompts to Systems

AI coding assistance is far more than just prompts and one-off requests. The true power lies in creating **systems and workflows that evolve with your needs**. This comprehensive analysis, based on Cole Medin's detailed guide, explores how to build custom AI coding workflows using a structured three-step methodology.

The core insight is simple yet profound: while existing frameworks like PRP, BMAD, and GitHub Spec Kit are valuable, understanding their underlying philosophy allows you to build systems tailored to your specific requirements and adapt them as your needs evolve.

## 2. The Three-Step Mental Model
