**TL;DR**:
- **Context7 MCP**: Memory Context Provider for AI models
- **Stdio Mode**: Run Context7 as a standalone process using standard input/output
- **Qwen Code CLI**: AI coding assistant that can use Context7 MCP
- **Global Integration**: Configure in `$HOME/.qwen/settings.json`

# Context7 MCP with Stdio Mode for Qwen Code CLI

Context7 MCP is a Memory Context Provider that enhances AI models with advanced context management capabilities. This guide shows how to install Context7 MCP in stdio mode and integrate it with Qwen Code CLI.

## What is Context7 MCP?

Context7 MCP provides extended context management for AI models, allowing them to maintain and utilize larger amounts of contextual information during interactions. It's particularly useful for complex coding tasks that require understanding of extensive project context.

## Installing Context7 MCP in Stdio Mode

To install Context7 MCP in stdio mode, you need to have `bun` installed first:

```bash
# Install bun if not already installed
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Once bun is installed, you can add Context7 MCP to Qwen using the built-in command:

```bash
qwen mcp add stdio bunx --bun -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

This command:
1. Adds a new MCP server in stdio mode
2. Uses `bunx` to run the Context7 MCP package
3. Installs `@upstash/context7-mcp` from the npm registry
4. Configures it automatically in Qwen's settings

## Integrating with Qwen Code CLI

The `qwen mcp add` command automatically configures Context7 MCP in Qwen's settings file located at `$HOME/.qwen/settings.json`. You can verify the configuration by checking the file:

```bash
cat $HOME/.qwen/settings.json
```

You should see an entry similar to:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Context7": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["--bun", "-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  },
  "selectedAuthType": "qwen-oauth",
  "hasSeenIdeIntegrationNudge": true,
  "ideMode": true
}
```

This configuration tells Qwen Code CLI to use `bunx` with the specified arguments when it needs to access the Context7 MCP server.

### Verifying the Integration

After configuring the integration, you can verify it works by running Qwen Code CLI:

```bash
qwen-code
```

When you use Qwen Code CLI, it will automatically connect to the Context7 MCP server through the stdio interface.

## Benefits of Stdio Mode

Running Context7 MCP in stdio mode provides several advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: No need to manage separate server processes
2. **Performance**: Direct communication through standard streams
3. **Reliability**: Fewer network-related issues
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Lower overhead compared to network-based communication

## Usage Example

Once configured, you can use Qwen Code CLI with Context7 MCP integration:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run Qwen Code CLI
qwen-code

# Qwen will automatically utilize Context7 MCP for enhanced context management
```

You can also verify that the MCP server is properly configured by listing the available MCP servers:

```bash
qwen mcp list
```

This will show all configured MCP servers, including Context7 if it was added successfully.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the integration:

1. **Check if Context7 MCP is installed**:
   ```bash
   which context7-mcp
   ```

2. **Verify the settings.json configuration**:
   ```bash
   cat $HOME/.qwen/settings.json
   ```

3. **Test Context7 MCP directly**:
   ```bash
   context7-mcp
   ```

## Conclusion

Context7 MCP in stdio mode provides enhanced context management for Qwen Code CLI. By configuring the integration in the global settings.json file, you can leverage extended context capabilities across all your projects without additional setup.

The stdio mode offers a simple and efficient way to run Context7 MCP without the complexity of network-based communication, making it ideal for local development environments.
