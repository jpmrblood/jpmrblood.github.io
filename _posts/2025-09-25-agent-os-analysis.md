## 1. Introduction

**Agent OS** represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted software development. Created by Builder Methods, this innovative framework addresses the fundamental challenge of AI coding agents: they often produce code that doesn't match team standards, coding styles, or project requirements.

The core insight behind Agent OS is that AI coding agents need more than just prompts—they need an **operating system** that provides structured context about how you build software, what you're building, and what you need built next.

## 2. The Three-Layer Context Architecture

Agent OS works by layering context—just like you'd onboard a human developer. Each layer builds on the previous one, creating a complete picture of how you build software.

### 2.1 Layer 1: Standards (How You Build Software)

The foundation layer defines your coding standards, style, best practices, and common tech stacks:

**Tech Stack Standards** (`tech-stack.md`)
- Default frameworks, libraries, and tools
- Version preferences and configurations
- Development environment setup

**Code Style Standards** (`code-style.md`)
- Formatting rules and naming conventions
- Language-specific style guidelines
- Code organization patterns

**Best Practices** (`best-practices.md`)
- Development philosophy (e.g., TDD, commit patterns)
- Patterns to follow and avoid
- Quality assurance standards

### 2.2 Layer 2: Product (What You're Building)

The product layer documents your mission, architecture, roadmap, and decisions:

**Mission** (`mission.md`)
- What you're building, for whom, and why it matters
- Target users and use cases
- Success metrics and goals

**Roadmap** (`roadmap.md`)
- Features shipped, in progress, and planned
- Development phases and milestones
- Priority and sequencing

**Decisions** (`decisions.md`)
- Key architectural and technical choices
- Rationale for major decisions
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered

**Product-Specific Stack** (`tech-stack.md`)
- Exact versions and configurations for this codebase
- Project-specific tooling and dependencies

### 2.3 Layer 3: Specs (What You Need Built Next)

The specs layer provides detailed plans and tasks for each feature:

**Spec Requirements Document (SRD)**
- Goals for the feature and user stories
- Success criteria and acceptance tests
- Business and technical requirements

**Technical Specifications**
- API design and database changes
- UI requirements and user flows
- Integration points and dependencies

**Task Breakdown**
- Trackable step-by-step implementation plan
- Dependencies and execution order
- TDD-focused task organization

## 3. Installation and Setup

## 8. Troubleshooting and Tips

### 8.1 Common Issues

**Agent Not Following Your Style:**
- Check standards files are specific enough
- Add examples to `code-style.md`
- Update `best-practices.md` with clear dos and don'ts

**Tasks Too Big or Too Small:**
- Review task breakdown during `/create-spec`
- Ask agent to adjust: "Can you break task 3 into smaller sub-tasks?"
- Or: "Tasks 2 and 3 should be combined"

**Wrong Technical Approach:**
- Review technical specs during planning phase
- Say: "I'd prefer we use [different approach] for this"
- Update relevant standards files to prevent future issues

### 8.2 Tips for Success

**Review Plans Carefully:**
- Planning phase is crucial—invest time here to save time later
- Review PRD and task breakdown before execution
- Ask agent to adjust plans if something doesn't look right
- Ensure alignment on approach before coding begins

**Start Small:**
- Don't try to document everything at once
- Begin with basic standards, refine as you go
- Add complexity gradually based on experience

**Be Specific:**
- ❌ "Use PostgreSQL" → ✅ "Use PostgreSQL 15+ with schemas for multi-tenancy"
- ❌ "Write tests" → ✅ "Write unit tests first, aim for 80% coverage"

**Trust the Process:**
- Let agent own entire features, not just snippets
- Review and refine rather than micromanage
- Allow agent to work autonomously with full context

**Know When to Start Fresh:**
- Not happy with implementation? Often better to revert and redo with better planning
- Don't ask agent to fix incorrectly implemented code—start clean with refined specs
- Clear redo usually beats incremental fixes
