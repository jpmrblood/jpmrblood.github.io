## How to Use These Models

### Installation Requirements

These models require the latest development version of Hugging Face Transformers:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@main
```

Note: Earlier versions will result in `KeyError: 'qwen3_next'` due to lack of Qwen3-Next architecture support.

### Running Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct with Hugging Face

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)

# Prepare input for chat
prompt = "Explain the significance of sparse MoE architecture in modern LLMs."
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]

# Apply chat template
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

# Tokenize and generate
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

# Decode response
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

### Running with SGLang for Enhanced Performance

For better performance, especially with the Multi-Token Prediction feature, you can use SGLang:

```bash
# Install SGLang with support for latest features
pip install 'sglang[all] @ git+https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git@main#subdirectory=python'

# Basic deployment:
SGLANG_ALLOW_OVERWRITE_LONGER_CONTEXT_LEN=1 python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8

# With Multi-Token Prediction:
SGLANG_ALLOW_OVERWRITE_LONGER_CONTEXT_LEN=1 python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct --port 30000 --tp-size 4 --context-length 262144 --mem-fraction-static 0.8 --speculative-algo NEXTN --speculative-num-steps 3 --speculative-eagle-topk 1 --speculative-num-draft-tokens 4
```

Then use the SGLang client for inference:

```python
import sglang as sgl

# Connect to the SGLang server
backend = sgl.RuntimeEndpoint("http://localhost:30000")
sgl.set_default_backend(backend)

# Define a function for chat
@sgl.function
def multi_turn_question(s, question):
    s += sgl.user(question)
    s += sgl.assistant(sgl.gen("answer"))

# Run the function
state = multi_turn_question.run(
    question="Explain the significance of sparse MoE architecture in modern LLMs."
)
print(state["answer"])
```

### Running Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)

# For reasoning tasks, you might want to use a more detailed prompt
prompt = """
Analyze the computational advantages of a sparse MoE model with 80B total parameters 
but only 3B active parameters during inference. Consider implications for hardware requirements.
"""

# Simple text input (Thinking model may work better with direct prompts)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# Generate with specific parameters for reasoning
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1024,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    do_sample=True
)

# Decode and print response
response = tokenizer.decode(generated_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### Using Qwen Agent for Agentic Mode

For advanced agentic capabilities, you can use Qwen-Agent:

```bash
# Install Qwen-Agent with all dependencies
pip install -U "qwen-agent[gui,rag,code_interpreter,mcp]"
```

Example of using Qwen Agent with the Instruct model:

```python
from qwen_agent.agents import Agent
from qwen_agent.tools import CodeInterpreter

# Configure the agent
llm_cfg = {
    'model': 'Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct',
    'model_type': 'transformers',  # or your deployment method
    'generate_cfg': {
        'top_p': 0.8,
    }
}

# Create an agent with tools
tools = [CodeInterpreter()]
agent = Agent(
    llm=llm_cfg,
    tools=tools
)

# Use the agent for complex tasks
response = agent.run("Calculate the factorial of 20 and plot a graph of factorials from 1 to 20.")
for step in response:
    print(step)
```
