# Using GitHub Spec Kit with Opencode CLI: Feature Request Integration Guide

GitHub Spec Kit is a powerful toolkit that enables specification-driven development, allowing organizations to focus on product scenarios rather than undifferentiated code. This guide covers the integration with Opencode CLI, which is currently available as a feature request in the development branch and will be included in future official releases of GitHub Spec Kit.

**Important Note**: This integration is currently a feature request and not yet available in the official GitHub Spec Kit release. It requires using the development fork by [@aemr3](https://github.com/aemr3) until the feature is merged into the main repository. The integration will be officially supported in upcoming releases.

## What is GitHub Spec Kit?

Before diving into the Opencode integration, let's understand what makes GitHub Spec Kit valuable:

### Core Features
- **AI-Powered Spec Generation**: Automatically creates detailed specifications from high-level requirements
- **Constitution-Based Development**: Follows proven architectural principles and anti-abstraction rules
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and soon Opencode CLI
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Breaks down complex projects into manageable, executable tasks

opencode config list

# Check for AGENTS.md file
ls -la AGENTS.md
```

### Step 4: Test Integration

```bash
# Launch Opencode CLI in the project
opencode

# Within Opencode CLI, test Spec Kit commands
/specify Create a simple web application with user authentication

/plan Use React for frontend, Node.js for backend, PostgreSQL for database

/tasks
```

## Integration with AI Applications

### Opencode CLI Integration

The integration allows you to use Spec Kit commands directly within Opencode CLI:

1. **Launch Opencode CLI** in your configured project directory
2. **Use Spec Kit Commands**:
   - `/specify` - Create specifications
   - `/plan` - Generate implementation plans
   - `/tasks` - Break down into executable tasks
   - `/implement` - Execute implementation

### Configuration for Opencode CLI

Ensure your Opencode CLI settings support the integration:

```bash
# Check current configuration
opencode config list

# Set appropriate model for spec work
opencode config set model opencode-pro

# Enable long context if available
opencode config set context-window 128k
```

### Other Compatible Tools

While primarily designed for Opencode CLI, the setup is compatible with:
- **Claude Code**: Use `--ai claude` instead of `--ai opencode`
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use `--ai copilot` for VS Code integration
- **Cursor**: Use `--ai cursor` for Cursor IDE integration

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Spec Kit Configuration
export SPEC_KIT_AI_AGENT=opencode
export SPEC_KIT_SCRIPT_TYPE=sh
export SPEC_KIT_DEBUG=true

# Opencode CLI Configuration
export OPENCODE_MODEL=opencode-pro
export OPENCODE_CONTEXT_WINDOW=128k
export OPENCODE_TIMEOUT=600000  # 10 minutes
```

### Custom Configuration Files

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env file for Spec Kit + Opencode integration
SPEC_KIT_AI_AGENT=opencode
SPEC_KIT_CONSTITUTION_STRICT=true
OPENCODE_MODEL=opencode-pro
OPENCODE_MAX_TOKENS=32000
```

### Performance Tuning

```bash
# Optimize for large specifications
export OPENCODE_MAX_TOKENS=64000
export SPEC_KIT_RESEARCH_PARALLEL=true
export SPEC_KIT_TASK_BATCH_SIZE=5
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Initialization Failures

uv cache clean
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aemr3/spec-kit.git specify init --ai opencode --debug

# If Git clone fails
git config --global http.sslVerify false
# Then retry the command
```

### Configuration Issues

```bash
# If AGENTS.md is not generated correctly
ls -la AGENTS.md
# Check if the file exists and has content

# Reset Opencode CLI configuration
opencode config reset
opencode config set model opencode-pro
```

### Integration Problems

```bash
# If Opencode CLI doesn't recognize Spec Kit commands
opencode config list
# Verify configuration is loaded

# Restart Opencode CLI
pkill -f opencode
opencode
```

### Template Issues

```bash
# If templates fail to download
# This is expected until the feature is merged
# Use the development fork as shown in commands above

# Check available templates
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aemr3/spec-kit.git specify check
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Spec Creation

```bash
# Create a simple API specification
